    <h2>About Feasting in the Great Hall</h2>
    <p>
      Feasts in Barley Hall were elaborate social events. Seating arrangements, food choices, and tableware all reflected hierarchy and hospitality. Each detail was meaningful.

    <h2>Seating & Service</h2>

    </div>
    <p>
      The lord and honored guests sat at the head table — the higher the status, the closer the seating. Servants brought food and drink from the buttery and pantry through service passages.

    <h2>Food & Utensils</h2>

    </div>
    <p>
      Meats like beef, pork, lamb, and poultry were typical, often roasted, boiled, or baked. Guests used knives, spoons, or even trencher bread as plates — forks were rare in this period.

      Did you know?  
      During special feasts, peacocks were roasted and presented with feathers carefully arranged — eye-catching but quite tough to eat!

    <h2>Fish & Fasting Customs</h2>
    <div class="img-block">

      <p><small>Illustration: Fish served during fasting periods.</small></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      During fasts like Lent and on Fridays, fish replaced meat. Freshwater and saltwater fish were both common. Curiously, beaver tails were sometimes classified as “fish” due to their scaly texture!

    <h2>Pigs & Banquets</h2>
    <div class="img-block">
      <img src="assets/pig_card.jpg" alt="Medieval pig illustration">
      <p><small>Illustration: Pigs, often farmed for common meals.</small></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Pigs were a staple but often seen as lower-class fare. Only the young “suckling pig” was fit for a noble banquet. In one quirky medieval event, a pig was even put on trial and executed for injuring a child!
