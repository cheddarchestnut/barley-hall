    <h2>Feasting in the Great Hall</h2>
    <p>Feasts in the late medieval period were more than just mealsâ€”they were public displays of wealth and social hierarchy. Guests were seated by rank, with the most esteemed closest to the head table. Food was served from the buttery and pantry by household staff.</p>

    <h2>Meats and More</h2>
    <p>The feast table featured meats like beef, pork, mutton, chicken, and even peacocks. Roasted birds were sometimes served with feathers reattached for decoration. Tools like flesh hooks helped lift hot meat from pots.</p>

    <h2>Fish and Fasting</h2>
    <p>Due to religious fasting, fish played an important role. Freshwater and saltwater fish were common, including cod, trout, and herring. Even beaver tails were considered "fish" because they were scaly and aquatic!</p>

    <h2>Pigs in the Middle Ages</h2>
    <p>Pigs were widely eaten but considered lower-class meat after the Norman conquest. Only piglets, or suckling pigs, were valued enough to appear at noble feasts. Pigs were also useful for cleaning food scraps.</p>
