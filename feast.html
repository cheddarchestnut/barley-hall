    <h2>Who Sat Where?</h2>
    <p>In Great Hall, where you sat meant everything. The family took pride of place at the head table, surrounded by their most honoured guests. The further down the table you were, the lower your social standing. Seating was a display of wealth, taste, and favour.</p>

    <h2>Meats and More</h2>
    <p>The feast table featured meats like beef, pork, mutton, chicken, and even peacocks. Roasted birds were sometimes served with feathers reattached for decoration. Tools like flesh hooks helped lift hot meat from pots.</p>

    <h2>Fish and Fasting</h2>
    <p>Due to religious fasting, fish played an important role. Freshwater and saltwater fish were common, including cod, trout, and herring. Even beaver tails were considered "fish" because they were scaly and aquatic!</p>

    <h2>Pigs in the Middle Ages</h2>
    <p>Pigs were widely eaten but considered lower-class meat after the Norman conquest. Only piglets, or suckling pigs, were valued enough to appear at noble feasts. Pigs were also useful for cleaning food scraps.</p>
