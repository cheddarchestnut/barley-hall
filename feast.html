    <h2>Who Sat Where?</h2>
    <p>In Great Hall, where you sat meant everything. The family took pride of place at the head table, surrounded by their most honoured guests. The further down the table you were, the lower your social standing. Seating was a display of wealth, taste, and favour.</p>

    <p class="fun-fact">See? Servants brought food and drink.</p>

  <div class="feast-section">
    <h2>Meats and More</h2>
    <p>The feast table usually featured meats like beef, pork, mutton, chicken, and even peacocks. Roasted birds were sometimes served with feathers reattached for decoration. Tools like flesh hooks helped lift hot meat from pots.</p>

    <h2>Fish, Fasting, and… Beavers?</h2>
    <p>Fish was central to the medieval diet, especially on fasting days like Fridays or Lent. But what counted as a “fish”? Surprisingly, beaver's tail qualified as fish simply because they lived in water.</p>

    <h2>Pigs in the Middle Ages</h2>
    <p>Pigs were widely eaten but considered lower-class meat after the Norman conquest. Only piglets, or suckling pigs, were valued enough to appear at noble feasts. Pigs were also useful for cleaning kitchen waste.</p>
